        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic 
          building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
          structure of web content. Other technologies besides
          HTML are generally used to describe a web page's 
          appearance/presentation (CSS) or 
          functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to 
          one another, either within a single website or between websites. 
          Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content 
          to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, 
          you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
        </p>

          HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and 
          other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup 
          includes special "elements" such as 
        </p>
        <code>&lt;body&gt;,
        &lt;html&gt;,
        &lt;head&gt;,
        &lt;title&gt;,
        &lt;header&gt;,
        &lt;footer&gt;,
        &lt;article&gt;,
        &lt;section&gt;,
        &lt;p&gt;,
        &lt;div&gt;,
        &lt;span&gt;,
        &lt;img&gt;,
        &lt;aside&gt;,
        &lt;audio&gt;,
        &lt;canvas&gt;,
        &lt;datalist&gt;,
        &lt;details&gt;,
        &lt;embed&gt;</code>
        and many others.

        <header>So what is HTML?</header>
        <p>
          HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
          HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, 
          or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain 
          way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or 
          image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make 
          the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the 
          following line of content:
        </p>
        <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
        <p>
          If we wanted the line to stand by itself, 
          we could specify that it is a paragraph by 
          enclosing it in paragraph tags:
        </p>
        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
        <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
        <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <img  class="image one"src="grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="fuck you">
        <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element 
            (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. 
            This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in 
            this case where the paragraph begins.
          </li>
          <li>
            The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it
            includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where 
            the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to 
            add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead 
            to strange results.
          </li>
          <li>
            The content: This is the content of the element, which 
            in this case, is just text.
          </li>
          <li>
            The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the
            content together comprise the element.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
        <code>&lt;p class="editor-note"&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <img class="image two" src="grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="fuck you once again">
        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't 
          want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name 
          and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you 
          to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it 
          (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information 
          and other things.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A space between it and the element name 
            (or the previous attribute, if the element 
            already has one or more attributes).
          </li>
          <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
        <header>Nesting elements</header>
        <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this 
          is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat 
          is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a 
          &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that the word is 
          to be strongly emphasized:
        </p>
        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <p>
          You do however need to make sure that your elements are 
          properly nested. In the example above, we opened the &lt;p&gt; 
          element first, then the &lt;strong&gt; element; therefore, we 
          have to close the &lt;strong&gt; element first, then the &lt;p&gt; element
          . The following is incorrect:
        </p>
        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
        <p>
          The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly 
          inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then your
          web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, 
          which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Empty_elements">
        <header>Empty elements</header>
        <p>Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. 
          Take the &lt;img&gt; element that we already have in our HTML page:
        </p>
        <code>
          &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
          This contains two attributes, but there is no closing &lt;/img&gt; tag 
          and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap 
          content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page 
          in the place it appears.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_document">
        <header>Anatomy of an HTML document</header>
        <p>
          That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, 
          but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at 
          how individual elements are combined to form an entire 
          HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into our index.html 
          example (which we first met in the Dealing with files article):
        </p>
        <code id="html-example">
          &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
          &lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&lt;head&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br>
          &lt;/html&gt;<br>
        </code>
        <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
        <ul id="last-ul">
          <li>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time,
            when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links 
            to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, 
            which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However these 
            days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document 
            behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all 
            the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It
            also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; — the &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts as a container 
            for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are 
            showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page 
            description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, 
            character set declarations, and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; — This element sets the character set your document should 
            use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written 
            languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. 
            There is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on.
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt; — This viewport element 
            ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from 
            rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; — the &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of your 
            page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is 
            also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; — the &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the 
            content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether 
            that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
          </li>
        </ul>
